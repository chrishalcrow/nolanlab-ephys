# nolanlab_ephys

To begin using, please download (clone) the repo from github. Then enter the directory and start using the codebase!

```
git clone https://github.com/chrishalcrow/nolanlab-ephys.git
cd nolanlab-ephys
```

Then you can run anything you'd like using `uv` e.g.

```
uv run code .
```

or make a venv using 

```
uv venv
```

## Using on EDDIE

The package is designed to be used on the Nolan Lab's data on your local computer or on EDDIE, the Edinburgh supercomputer. To run a spike sorting pipeline on Eddie, do the following. First, log on to EDDIE and get a login node:

``` bash
ssh edinburgh_username@eddie.ecdf.ed.ac.uk
... wait to get on to eddie ...
qlogin -l h_vmem=8G
```

We'll now install this package. EDDIE has a 2TB scratch you can use to put stuff in. We'll navigate to there (then into wherever you want to store this code. I've made a `my_project/code` folder), download ("clone") this package, then navigate into the package:

``` bash
cd /exports/eddie/scratch/chalcrow/my_project/code
git clone https://github.com/chrishalcrow/nolanlab-ephys.git
cd nolanlab-ephys
```

Now you can run some scripts! Each script is kept in `scripts/experiment/blah.py`. Each step of each experimenters pipeline bespoke script. For it to run, it needs to know some info. For spike sorting it needs to know the: mouse, day, sessions, sorting protocol, folder to put the data on the scratch, folder to put the derivatives on the scratch. Here's an example on my login (note: you need to change chalcrow to something else):

``` bash
uv run scripts/wolf/sort_on_eddie.py 25 20 OF1,VR,OF2 kilosort4A --data_folder /exports/eddie/scratch/chalcrow/wolf/data/ --deriv_folder /exports/eddie/scratch/chalcrow/wolf/derivatives
```

The different spike sorting protocols can be found in `src/nolanlab_ephys/si_protocols.py`.
